I.	Introduction
Collaborative robots (cobots) are becoming an integral part of modern manufacturing and automation due to their flexibility, precision, and enhanced safety features. Unlike outmoded industrial robots, cobots are designed to work in conjunction with human operators, improving efficiency and adaptability. However, operational inefficiencies, unexpected failures, and maintenance issues can lead to costly downtime, reducing overall productivity and increasing operational costs.
Key objectives include:
1.	Predicting Tool Current Using Regression Analysis
2.	Clustering Operational States to Identify Patterns
3.	Classifying Protective Stop Events to Prevent Failures
4.	Reducing Dimensionality for Better Interpretability

II.	Background / Related Work / Data Analysis
Predictive maintenance has become crucial in industrial automation, aiming to minimize downtime and reduce maintenance costs. Machine learning enables comprehensive analysis of sensor data to predict equipment failures and detect anomalies. Previous research has demonstrated the effectiveness of various techniques:
•	Regression models forecast equipment failures by analyzing sensor trends
•	Clustering techniques (e.g., K-means) identify operational states
•	Classification algorithms detect potential failures by categorizing data
The application of predictive maintenance to collaborative robots (cobots) remains limited. Cobots have unique operational characteristics requiring specialized analysis, generating complex data from multiple joints. This project applies machine learning techniques specifically to UR3 cobot data, focusing on joint currents, temperatures, and speeds.
By leveraging regression, clustering, and classification models, the research aims to provide actionable insights for optimizing cobot performance and reliability in industrial environments. The study contributes to the emerging field of predictive maintenance for cobots, addressing their distinctive operational challenges.
